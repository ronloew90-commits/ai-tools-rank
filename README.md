# AI Tools Rank

A lightweight decision-support project exploring how people choose AI tools for specific tasks in a fast-moving, hype-driven market.

## Why this project exists
As the number of AI tools increased, it became harder for non-technical users to decide which tool was appropriate for a given task. Most comparisons focus on features or marketing claims rather than real usage and decision-making behaviour.

This project was created to explore whether simple crowd-informed input could surface more practical signal.

## What it does
AI Tools Rank allows users to:
- Select a task or use case
- View how different AI tools are ranked based on early user input
- Compare tools through a decision lens rather than technical depth

The focus is on usability and decision quality, not model development.

## How it was tested
The project was released publicly and used by an initial cohort of ~150 early users.  
Usage patterns and feedback were used to iterate on structure, clarity, and ranking logic.

## What this project is not
- Not a commercial product  
- Not a startup  
- Not positioned as a competing platform or service  

This is an experimentation and learning project built alongside AI enablement and training work.

## Key learnings
- Users value task-based guidance more than feature comparisons  
- Too much choice reduces confidence rather than increasing it  
- Simple ranking mechanisms can meaningfully improve decision speed  

## Status
The project remains a learning and experimentation space and may evolve as insights emerge.
